# This is my Website's Source Code

My portfolio website uses code from Vercel's NextJS Github repository in order to function. However, this code is heavily modified from the original and has vastly different content. 

The website uses:
 - [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
 - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 - [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
 - [Remark / Remark-HTML](https://remark.js.org/)
in order to function.
