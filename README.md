# This is my Website's Source Code

My portfolio website uses code from [Vercel's NextJS Github Repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) in order to function. However, this code is heavily modified from the original and has vastly different content. 

The website uses these resources in order to function:
 - [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
 - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
 - [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
 - [Remark / Remark-HTML](https://remark.js.org/)
